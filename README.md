🚀 3 + 14 Days of JavaScript & React Sprint

Welcome to my 3 + 14 Days of JavaScript & React Sprint — a focused, practical journey to master JavaScript fundamentals and smoothly transition into React development.

This sprint is part of my larger goal to build a creative web developer portfolio showcasing both UI design and frontend development skills.
I’ll be documenting progress daily and hosting the final projects on GitHub Pages.

🧠 Overview

This sprint is designed to:

Strengthen JavaScript logic and syntax before diving into React.

Learn React step-by-step — from components and hooks to projects.

Build and host portfolio-worthy mini projects using React.

Maintain daily consistency with short, achievable goals.

The plan is split into two phases:

3 Days → JavaScript Refresher (Core Logic & Syntax)

14 Days → React Learning + Mini Projects
