# 🚀 JavaScript Learning Sprint

Welcome to my **JavaScript Learning Sprint** — a hands-on 17-day journey to master the fundamentals of JavaScript through structured daily goals, revision, and practical exercises.

Each day focuses on building a stronger foundation in logic, syntax, and problem-solving — from **basics to arrays, objects, and beyond.**

---

## 🧠 Overview

This sprint is designed to:
- Strengthen JavaScript fundamentals for frontend interviews.  
- Improve logic-building skills using exercises instead of relying on built-in methods.  
- Build daily consistency through bite-sized learning and practice.  

I’m focusing on **manual logic**, **small projects**, and **progressive learning**, rather than shortcuts or libraries.
