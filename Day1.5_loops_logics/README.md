# 🧠 Day 01.5 – Loops & Nested Logic

## 📘 Overview
In this session, we expanded our JavaScript fundamentals by exploring **loops**, **nested loops**, and **logical flow** in greater detail.  
We practiced using loops to control repetition, handle patterns, and perform calculations efficiently.

---

## 🧩 Topics Covered

### 🔁 Loop Types
- `for` loop  
- `while` loop  
- `do...while` loop  
- Nested loops

### ⚙️ Concepts Practiced
- Loop initialization and condition updates  
- `break` and `continue` usage  
- Combining logical operators in loops  
- Pattern generation using nested loops

## 🧠 Mini Exercises

1️⃣ **Print numbers 1–10** using all three loop types  
2️⃣ **Sum of all even numbers** from 1–50  
3️⃣ **Countdown** from 10 to 1 using `while`  
4️⃣ **Prime number check** using loops and conditionals  
5️⃣ **All prime numbers** between 1–50  
6️⃣ **Multiplication table (1–5)** using nested loops  
7️⃣ **Star pattern** (increasing)  
8️⃣ **Inverted star pattern**  
9️⃣ **Left-aligned triangle** (with spaces)

## 💡 Key Takeaways
- Loops help **automate repetitive tasks** and avoid manual repetition.  
- Nested loops enable **multi-level iteration**, crucial for patterns and grids.  
- The `break` statement exits a loop early when a condition is met.  
- Combining loops and logic operators unlocks powerful problem-solving techniques.
